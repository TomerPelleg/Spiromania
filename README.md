# Spiromania

### Project by Tomer and Lael, University of Haifa  (2021-22)

A spirograph is a wonderful toy, which is composed of just 2 circles but can draw mesmerising patterns!

Here we explore some of the hidden potential which comes from a digital implementation of a spirograph:

* More than one circle within a circle! (done)
* Visualise fourier transforms with spirographs! (done)
* Answer the *burning* question: what patterns could we draw if we used shapes other than circles?
